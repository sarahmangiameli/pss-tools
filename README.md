# About pss-tools
This repository contains nalysis scripts to reproduce main figures in Photoselective sequencing: microscopically-guided genomic measurements with subcellular resolution

# Contents
[scripts:](https://github.com/sarahmangiameli/pss-tools/tree/main/scripts) This directory contains the analysis scripts. Scripts that are meant to be run directly to can be found in the figure directory that corresponds to the main text figure where the analysis was presented.

[reference:](https://github.com/sarahmangiameli/pss-tools/tree/main/reference) This directory contains reference information such as chromosome lengths for various genome builds and the genomic bins for the enrichment plots in Fig. 3.

[figures:](https://github.com/sarahmangiameli/pss-tools/tree/main/figures) This directory contains example output files from the analysis scripts.

[data:](https://github.com/sarahmangiameli/pss-tools/tree/main/data) This directory contains raw data required to run the scripts such as aligned reads, tables, and images.
